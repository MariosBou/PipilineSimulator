# MIPS Simulator Suite

This project is a **MIPS Simulator Suite** written in **C++**. It includes multiple types of MIPS simulators:

- **Single-Cycle Simulator**
- **Multi-Cycle Simulator**
- **Pipelined Simulator** (5-stage: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB)
- **Cache Simulator**

Each simulator models different aspects of MIPS instruction execution and performance.
nerates control signals based on instruction type
